# AI_ML_based_chatbot
chat bot using TensorFlow - keras and other AI ML techniques
This repository contains the working code for a chat bot.
The .ipynb file can be run on Jupyter Notebook or preferably Google Colab.
For the front end, the chatbot is designed using Dialogflow.
To embed the chat bot in your web page, you can include the following link in your html body:
"https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/demo/embedded/49dfb0cd-d5ec-4ac3-ac7f-77678ad3cea5"
The html file can also be used to run the chat bot.
